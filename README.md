# Assembly Makefile Generator

This Python script generates a Makefile for assembling and linking an assembly language program.

## Usage

1. Move the Python script to a directory that's already in your PATH. A common choice is `/usr/local/bin`. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
mv makefile.py /usr/local/bin/makefile
```

2. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/makefile
```

Now, you should be able to run the script from any directory by typing `./makefile` in your terminal.

Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions to move files to `/usr/local/bin` and to make them executable. If you don't, you might need to prefix the commands with `sudo`.
